;; TODO maybe this is a good protocol?
;; how to track dirty bits...
;; could model w/ monad (ground state dirty unless loaded from storage),
;;     gets cleaned after each flush-flood
;; flush-flood is the BFS for all dirty nodes; individual nodes must be flushable
;; A storage backend must be able to take a node as arg, serialize, assign addr,
;;    and call "clean" on the node to allow it to have a backing addr
;;
;; Maybe disk backing shouldn't be done as a monad, since that woud double
;; the total IOPS when 2 users of a snapshot need flush/clones
;; (N uses makes N useless copies).
;;
;; So perhaps each node can have a promise, it's address on storage.
;; When someone wants to flush it, they first dump it to disk, then try to clean it.
;; If the clean succeeds, they're done. If the clean fails (i.e. deliver fails),
;; they roll back the write and read the address from the promise.
;;
;; Monads will be reserved for things we want persisted, rather than the
;; in-memory flushing system, which can afford extra communication
;;
;; We can totally rely on a caching layer to manage keeping nodes around for
;; when a single tree is passed to several different consumers. This layer
;; will make it easier ta manage the overall JVM's memory allocation, and
;; it's far simpler than trying to use weak pointers to track unresolved addrs
;; so that we can supply the data to all of them when we fetch it. The cache
;; will also have better GC properties, by not accidentally sticking random
;; tree bits into jvm GC roots that could be held a long time.
;;
;; So flushing writes are shared, but loading from disk is cached instead.
;; Maybe write flushing could itself just be a smaller (or bigger) "write cache"...
;; no, that could be defeated by really big writes, which are already guaranteed
;; to be resident (since they were pending and thus linked to the tree's root).
;;
;; We'll make an IOPS measuring backend, which specifically makes "fake" addrs
;; that keep pointers to the nodes they "stored". Importantly, it needs to record
;; each read and write operation into counters, so that we can run a test
;; and check the total IOPS we spent.
;;
;; The advanced work with this will allow us to define hard IOPS bounds
;; (based on proven data), and then send generated loads to check we stay within
;; our targets.

;; The parts of the serialization system that seem like they're need hooks are:
;; - Must provide a function that takes a node, serializes it, and returns an addr
;; - Must be able to rollback writing an addr
;; - Whatever the addr it returns, it should cache its resolve in-mem somehow
;; - The serialize a node & rollback a node functions should accept a "stats" object as well
;; - The "stats" object must be convertible to a summary or whatever at the end
